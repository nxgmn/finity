Evaluating App Ideas:
-
2.1: Task / calendar Tracker

- Mobile: is easily accessible both as a simple task list and so its easy to track on a calendar.
- Story: makes it easier to be organized, while being less anxiety inducing
- Market: anyone who has a lot of things to do at once, and gets overwhelmed easily by having too many tasks.
- Habit: Can put tasks in advance, but will only show tasks for the current day on a focus screen. So will keep a full running list, but allows for easy prioritization. Keeps users coming back because of daily / constant use
- Scope: I will be making a small scope version of the app, with a basic task list and a focus screen just based on date, along with a full calendar. If I have time, I would want to include weights to the tasks, for how much time they would take and such and change how early they appear on the focus screen based on the weights of the task.

2.2: Journal App
- Mobile: Easy to record, doesn't have to be super thought out. Can offer prompts. Could also just record mood and not write anything.
- Story: Lets you track your mood over time, maybe find triggering factors and such, or just make it look cool with a cool visual.
- Market: People who like to be in tune with their feelings
- Habit: It looks cool, but it will only look cool the more your consistent with it.
- Scope: Create the basic layout to create and save journal entries. if possible, find a way to make a cool visual with it too.

2.2: Tip Calculator
- Mobile: Easy to access when tipping, and easy to input information
- Story: Tip is hard to calculate, especially when trying to think about all the factors that go into what a fair tip may be. or just to do the math because math is hard.
- Market: Anyone who goes out to eat or is subject to tipping culture.
- Habit: Tipping culture is probably going to be around for a while so I think there is usually a pretty big need for it.
- Scope: Make a couple different layouts for different ways to calculate tip. one with basic price input with the percentage, and one with questions like price, service rating, affordability, and calculate a tip and final price based off that. *(make sure to ask for state)*
