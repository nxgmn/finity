## Overview

Finity is a simple task manager that allows you to view, plan, and focus on tasks one at a time out of the many to do. 

### Description

Finity consists of a few key features.

Calendar: to view all of the tasks at once, or just to see if there are any leftover tasks to carry over from the next day.
Task creator: allows you to create new tasks, assigning coresponding dates,times, and priority level.
Home Screen: shows your one or more (user-specified) amount of tasks to focus on, to help jumpstart your productivity for the day.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
 - Mobile: is easily accessible both as a simple task list and so its easy to track on a calendar.
 - Story: makes it easier to be organized, while being less anxiety inducing.
 - Market: anyone who has a lot of things to do at once, and gets overwhelmed easily by having too many tasks.
 - Habit: can put tasks in advance, but will only show tasks for the current day on a focus screen. So will keep a full running list, but allows for easy prioritization. Keeps users coming back because of daily / constant use
 - Scope: I will be making a small scope version of the app, with a basic task list and a focus screen just based on date, along with a full calendar. If I have time, I would want to include weights to the tasks, for how much time they would take and such and change how early they appear on the focus screen based on the weights of the task.
